# ApplesInTheWorld
ASP.NET website to let user view popular apples in the world, user also can view food and wines made by apple.After login, user can contribute to this website by add/edit content.The idea comes from newspaper ,one day I saw an article about an elder person who collects various apple categories. So I think maybe it is very interesting to let people know there are how many apples in the world.
